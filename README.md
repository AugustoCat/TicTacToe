This is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid and includes features such as dynamic player names, turn indication, win/draw detection, and restart functionality.

- Winning Combination Highlighting: The winning combination is visually highlighted with a green background.
- Draw Detection: If all cells are filled and no player wins, a draw is declared.
- Restart Button: Start a new game at any time using the restart button, clearing the grid.
